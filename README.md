# Project MarketPlace
Boeing Intern iHack 2015

##Description
Project Marketplace is an application that we developed to fix an issue that we all encountered during our internships. We all came from top notch schools to work at Boeing, and sometimes the main project we were working on with our team would be delayed due to the need for approvals, or other issues. Instead of sitting around, and wasting valuable company time waiting for such approval, we felt that we could work on other side projects that different teams needed done, that required skills that we had. As such, interns could provide more value to the company, and learn more about other departments that they do not work for full time.

##How it works
Project Marketplace consists of three main components:

1. Intern Profiles
2. Manager Profiles
3. Open Projects Page

Both interns and managers have individual profiles that list their skills, the amount of time they have, or the type of intern they are looking for. Once an intern or a manager has created a profile, they can check the Open Projects page and search for projects matching their time available, or skills. Managers can post open projects, and can search for interns with specific skills to carry out their project.

We hope that future interns will be able to use our application so that they can have more fulfilling and fun internships while at Boeing.
